# AxoDen Beta User Guide - Claude Code Integration

Welcome to the AxoDen beta program! This guide will help you integrate AxoDen's AI-powered approach recommendations into your Claude Code development workflow.

## 🎯 What is AxoDen?

AxoDen is an intelligent development guidance system that provides data-driven approach recommendations from a proprietary knowledge base of proven problem-solving techniques. When integrated with Claude Code, it transforms reactive problem-solving into systematic, approach-driven development.

## 🚀 Beta Access Setup

### Step 1: Request Beta Access
1. Visit https://axoden.com/beta
2. Fill out the beta access form
3. You'll receive an API key via email within 24 hours

### Step 2: Install AxoDen Client
```bash
# Clone the client repository (during beta)
git clone https://github.com/YalcinkayaE/axoden-client.git
cd axoden-client

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

*Note: After beta, install via: `pip install axoden-client`*

### Step 3: Configure Your API Key

**Recommended: Easy Setup**
```bash
axoden setup-key  # Choose clipboard paste (easiest!)
```

**Alternative: Environment Variable**
```bash
export AXODEN_API_KEY='your_beta_api_key'
axoden config --test
```

**Alternative: Full Interactive Setup**
```bash
axoden quickstart
```

💡 **Pro Tip**: Copy your API key to clipboard first, then use `axoden setup-key` for the smoothest experience!

## 💡 How AxoDen Enhances Claude Code

### Traditional Claude Code Workflow
```
You: "Help me fix these test failures"
Claude: *Generic debugging advice*
Result: Trial and error approach
```

### AxoDen-Enhanced Workflow
```
You: axoden recommend "fix persistent test failures in pytest"
AxoDen: Returns systematic debugging approach with specific steps
You: "Apply the recommended testing approach to fix these pytest failures"
Claude: *Systematic implementation following proven methodology*
Result: Structured, effective solution
```

## 📚 Core Use Cases

### 1. Debugging Problems
```bash
# Get debugging approach
axoden recommend "debug memory leak in FastAPI application"

# Example output:
🎯 Recommended Approach: Memory Profiling Pipeline
📊 Confidence: 85%
📋 Implementation Steps:
1. Set up profiling and monitoring tools
2. Instrument suspected code areas
3. Execute controlled testing scenarios
4. Analyze resource allocation patterns
5. Implement targeted optimizations
```

### 2. Architecture Decisions
```bash
# Get architecture guidance
axoden recommend "design scalable microservices architecture" \
  --context '{"team_size": 5, "language": "python"}'

# Returns: Domain-Driven Design with specific implementation steps
```

### 3. Performance Optimization
```bash
# Analyze project and get optimization strategies
axoden analyze --path ./src

# Returns targeted performance approaches based on codebase analysis
```

### 4. Code Quality Improvements
```bash
# Get refactoring approach
axoden recommend "refactor legacy Django monolith"

# Returns: Strangler Fig Pattern with migration steps
```

## 🔄 Integration Workflows

### Quick Copy-Paste Workflow
```bash
# 1. Get recommendation and auto-copy to clipboard
python -m axoden_client.claude_integration "implement rate limiting"

# 2. Paste into Claude Code session
# 3. Claude now has approach context for better assistance
```

### File-Based Workflow
```bash
# 1. Save recommendation to file
axoden recommend "implement OAuth2 authentication" --save

# 2. Reference in Claude Code:
# "I have AxoDen's approach in axoden_recommendation_*.md, please implement"
```

### Project Analysis Workflow
```bash
# 1. Analyze entire project
axoden analyze

# 2. Get project-specific approach recommendations
# 3. Apply systematically with Claude Code
```
